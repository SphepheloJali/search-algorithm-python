Search Algorithms - README
Overview
This Assignment includes:
 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
 Depth-First Search (DFS)
 A* Search
 Greedy Algorithm
 (and Report)
 Additionally Tree Diagram
Files
 BFS.py
 DFS.py
 Astar.py
 Greedy.py
 2.Report.txt (Contains a report from #2 (15 marks))
How to Run
1. Run :
o For BFS: python BFS.py f
o For DFS: python DFS.py
o For A* Search: python Astar.py
o For Greedy Search: python Greedy.py
2. View Report:
o Open 2.Report.txt for details on the algorithms and their performance.
